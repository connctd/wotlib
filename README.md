# WoT Lib

This lib was created to simplify work with WoT Thing Descriptions.
It is coupled to W3C's recommendation from 9 April 2020 (https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-wot-thing-description-20200409/) which means it assumes a certain structure.

## Working principle

Read TD -> Expand -> Put into well known struct -> Perform operations
